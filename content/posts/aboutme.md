## Hello, it's Miya. (ﾉ◕ヮ◕)ﾉ*:･ﾟ✧

I am Miya Lee, a Paris based software engineer who graduated from National Taiwan Normal University, Taiwan, with a B.S. in computer science and information engineering.

I devote myself to constructing useful applications that inspire and assist people to have a better life. I expertise in C/C++, JavaScript(Node.js with Express), and Python. I currently look forward to a back-end fulltime.

Also, I'm learning French which I personal think it's even harder than any programming language I have learnt. I love animations, picture books, romantic comedy series and films, and traveling.
